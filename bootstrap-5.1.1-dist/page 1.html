<h2> MANAGEMENT </h2>
<p>
We focus on management education more than just business management. The commitment is thought leadership with a deep understanding of business. The approach to pedagogy combines fieldwork, case studies, research and instrumented feedback with a strong emphasis on concepts and theory.

We, as a Faculty of Commerce & Management, are training our students to cope up with pressure of fierce competition. Our education is a fair blend of human behaviour, organizational psychology & behaviour, human resource management, economics, quantitative methods, finance & accounts,marketing, production & operations, and information technology. Students are given ample opportunity to cultivate creativity and exploit innovations in the work culture. Visits of personnels from corporate world and academia are part of our curriculum to apprise the students of the corporate needs and the latest developments in theory. Industrial visits and trainings are arranged to simulate the ground realities of corporate work and culture into their minds.

Lack of communication skills and ethics poses many problems in our day to day working which become serious with passage of time. Therefore, the students are being given due attention to embed these so that they could come up to the expectations of the customers, organizations and society in a sustainable manner and add value to their job.
